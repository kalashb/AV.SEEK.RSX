# AV.SEEK.RSX  
AV for SEEK 2024 by RSX UofT  

### Initial Setup and Configuration:
- **Sensor Integration:** Explored the connections between the IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, and Arduino utilizing the breadboard for seamless interfacing.
- **Code Acquisition:** Obtained and analyzed specific Arduino code modules essential for integrating the sensors effectively.

### Servo Implementation:
- **Code Implementation:** Integrated servo motors into the project, utilizing pre-existing Arduino code and fine-tuning it to meet project requirements.
- **Calibration:** Conducted calibration procedures to ensure precise servo movements, particularly configuring them to rotate smoothly by 90 degrees at periodic intervals, minimizing sudden motions for stability.

### Ultrasonic Sensor Optimization:
- **Sensor Calibration:** Rigorously calibrated the ultrasonic sensor's settings, ensuring accurate detection within the designated range of 1 to 800 centimeters.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Implemented code to display real-time distance measurements on the output terminal, facilitating continuous monitoring and adjustment as needed.

### Mechanical Assembly:
- **Preparation:** Prepared the acrylic chassis board by removing its cover to facilitate further assembly.
- **Motor Connection:** Methodically connected motors to the chassis board using appropriate nuts and secured wheels onto the motors to enable locomotion.
- **Functional Integration:** Seamlessly integrated the turning wheel with the chassis board, establishing its synchronization with the IR sensor for responsive navigation.
